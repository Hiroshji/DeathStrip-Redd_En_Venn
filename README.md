# Deathtrip: Redd en Venn

A short interactive game that raises awareness about the dangers of impaired driving.

## Overview

**Deathtrip: Redd en Venn** is a visual-novel-style decision-making game developed using Python and Pygame.

The gameâ€™s narrative is driven by dialogue choices, and every decision affects the outcome of the story.

- **Configurable Audio:** Adjust the volume for sound effects and music separately using in-game sliders. Configuration is handled by functions in [`settings.py`](code/settings.py).
- **Multiple Scenes:** The game offers several scenes (e.g., "start", "scene_2", "scene_3", "scene_4", and ending scenes) to simulate the consequences of each choice.
- **Custom UI Elements:** Animated buttons and dialogue boxes enhance the visual interaction ([`AnimatedButton`](code/game.py)).
